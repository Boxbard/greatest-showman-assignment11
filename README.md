In this assignment, you will work with a group to design and code a responsive website.

Difficulties: 
- Creating a responsive navigation bar - we struggled with overlapping of the navigation links on top of the nav logo. We created a media query to try and solve this issue.
- Adding social media icons to footer - we struggled with adding the icons to the footer based on the wireframe that we created. We resolved this issue by using Font Awesome keys for the icons. 
- Ensuring responsiveness overall - we struggled with creating responsive layouts with the use of media queries on the Home and About page specifically. Research was completed to ensure that our media queries worked properly.
    - We could only get the media queries for iPhone on the Home and About page to show results under the 'iPhone 12 Pro' selection on Inspector tools.
- Creation of Video pages and the use of iFrames was difficult to work with. It was a challenge to align the iframes and embedded videos properly.
