Difficulties: 
- Creating a responsive navigation bar - we struggled with overlapping of the navigation links on top of the nav logo. We created a media query to try and solve this issue.
- Adding social media icons to footer - we struggled with adding the icons to the footer based on the wireframe that we created. We resolved this issue by using Font Awesome keys for the icons. 
- Ensuring responsiveness overall - we struggled with creating responsive layouts with the use of media queries on the Home and About page specifically. Research was completed to ensure that our media queries worked properly.
    - We could only get the media queries for iPhone on the Home and About page to show results under the 'iPhone 12 Pro' selection on Inspector tools.
- Creation of Video pages and the use of iFrames was difficult to work with. It was a challenge to align the iframes and embedded videos properly.
- When we deployed site to GitHub pages, the sidebar layout we created did not appear as it did in live server. When inspecting the code, the code for the width of the two columns for the text and sidebar are crossed out. The code is written, but is not being used.
